Project Title: Identify premium pricing attributes for home insurance using R/Python
Description: Home insurance premiums are influenced by a variety of factors that insurers consider when determining the risk associated with a policy. These attributes can include property characteristics, policyholder information, and geographic factors. Understanding these attributes is crucial for both insurance companies to set accurate pricing and for customers to manage their insurance costs effectively.
